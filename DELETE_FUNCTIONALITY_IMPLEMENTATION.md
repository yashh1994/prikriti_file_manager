# Delete Functionality Implementation

## Backend Updates

### üîß Service Layer (`simple-file-metadata.service.ts`)
- **`deleteFileByName(filename: string)`**: Deletes file from filesystem
- **`fileExists(filename: string)`**: Checks if file exists before operations
- Proper error handling and logging

### üåê Controller Layer (`simple-file-metadata.controller.ts`)
- **`deleteFile`** endpoint handler
- Validates filename parameter
- Checks file existence before deletion
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and messages
- Comprehensive error handling

### üõ£Ô∏è Routes Layer (`simple-file-metadata.routes.ts`)
- **`DELETE /api/file-metadata/delete/:filename`** endpoint
- RESTful API design following DELETE method conventions

## Frontend Updates

### üì° Service Layer (`fileService.ts`)
- **`deleteFile(filename: string)`**: Calls backend DELETE API
- Returns structured response with success status and message
- Proper URL encoding for filenames

### üé® UI Components

#### FileList Component
- Added red delete button (trash icon) for each file
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Loading state management during deletion
- Proper error handling and user feedback

#### App Component
- **`handleFileDelete`** function for deletion logic
- Updates local state after successful deletion
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Automatic UI refresh after deletion

### üéØ User Experience Features
- **Confirmation Dialog**: "Are you sure you want to delete...?" 
- **Visual Feedback**: Button disabling during deletion
- **Immediate UI Update**: File removed from list without page refresh
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if deletion fails

## API Endpoints

### New DELETE Endpoint
```
DELETE /api/file-metadata/delete/:filename
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "File 'document.pdf' deleted successfully"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400`: Missing filename
- `404`: File not found  
- `500`: Server error during deletion

## Security Considerations
- Filename validation and sanitization
- Path traversal protection (using path.join)
- Proper error messages without exposing system details

## UI Design
- Red delete button with trash icon
- Hover effects with red accent colors
- Confirmation dialog for safety
- Loading states and disabled buttons
- Consistent with Material Design theme

The delete functionality is now fully integrated into the file metadata system with proper backend validation, frontend confirmation, and seamless user experience!
