## API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/files/list-folder` | POST | Load files from a folder |
| `/api/files/rename` | PUT | Update file names |
| `/api/files/upload` | POST | Upload files to server |
| `/api/files/stats` | GET | Get upload statistics |
| `/health` | GET | Health check |

## File Status Indicators

- ðŸŸ¢ **Done**: File uploaded successfully
- ðŸ”´ **Failed**: Upload failed (error message shown)
- ðŸŸ  **Duplicate**: Duplicate file detected (same content)
- âšª **Pending**: Waiting to be uploaded

## Key Features Explained

### Duplicate Detection
The system checks for duplicate files based on content (MD5 hash), not just filename. If a duplicate is detected, the file won't be uploaded again.

### Name Conflict Resolution
If a file with the same name already exists in the uploads folder, the system automatically adds a timestamp to the filename to avoid conflicts.

### Error Handling
- **Invalid file names**: Automatically sanitized
- **Missing source files**: Reported as failed
- **Network errors**: User-friendly error messages
- **Server errors**: Detailed error information
